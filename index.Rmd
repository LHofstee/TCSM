# Course {-}

In this course you will learn how to translate a social scientific theory into a statistical model, how to analyze your data with these models, and how to interpret and report your results following APA standards.

The analyses will be executed using the statistical programming environment R, and in particular using the structural equation modeling package lavaan.
