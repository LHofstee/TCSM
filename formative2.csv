"When conducting an exploratory factor analysis, cross-loadings are assumed to be zero.","""TRUE""",FALSE,"In exploratory factor analysis, all items load on all factors. Thus, all possible cross-loadings are estimated (even if we sometimes suppress small ones in the output). See Lecture, slide 38 (EFA)."
Promax rotation in factor analysis is a specific form of orthogonal rotation.,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"Promax rotation is an oblique rotation which is computationally faster than oblimin. See Lecture, slide 52 (Factor Rotation)."
What is the maximum number of latent variables when conducting Exploratory Factor Analysis with 5 items?,"c(""Only one; you need at least 3 indicators per latent variable."", ""Two; you need 3 indicators for one latent variable, but the model is still identified due to the covariance between latent variables."", ""No limit; you can keep adding latent variables, but they will explain ever decreasing amounts of variance."")","""Five; the same as the number of indicators.""","You can perform exploratory factor analysis with at most as many factors as indicators (but typically a theoretical maximum is set). See: Lecture, e.g. parallel analysis goes up to the number of indicators."
EFA models the covariances among items; PCA describes the total variance of items.,"""FALSE""",TRUE,"EFA estimates a measurement model on the covariance matrix of the items; in this model, all cross-loadings are estimated, and certain constraints are imposed to make the model identified. PCA is just a rotation of the data in space. It thus explains the total variance of the data. See Lecture, slide 15."
"With PCA, you must indicate the number of factors to extract a-priori.","""TRUE""",FALSE,"PCA merely rotates the data in space. Every item adds a dimension to that space (so 3 indicators = 3-dimensional space). Software may allow you to specify the number of components (not factors) you are interested in - but that does not change the analysis, it just means the remaining components are omitted from the output. See Lecture, slide 16."
